# Symbolic Hyperdimensional Vectors with Sparse Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

This is the repository for the code for the paper [Symbolic Hyperdimensional Vectors with Sparse Graph Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9892300). The code is adapted from the code for the paper [Optimization of Graph Neural Networks with Natural Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09624), [whose code can be found here](https://github.com/russellizadi/ssp). Their code has in turn adapted from [github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) and [github.com/Thrandis/EKFAC-pytorch](https://github.com/Thrandis/EKFAC-pytorch).

## Run experiments

Clone the repository and change your current directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/filco306/GNN-random-indexing.git
cd GNN-random-indexing
```
Install 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Go to the `experiments` folder:
```
cd experiments
bash scripts/EXPERIMENTNAME
```




## Acknowledgements

This repository is a modification of the implementation of the [Optimization of Graph Neural Networks with Natural Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09624). You might want to cite their paper too if you re-use this code :)
