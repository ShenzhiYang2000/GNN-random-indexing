# Symbolic Hyperdimensional Vectors with Sparse Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

This is the repository for the code for the paper [Symbolic Hyperdimensional Vectors with Sparse Graph Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9892300). The code is adapted from the code for the paper [Optimization of Graph Neural Networks with Natural Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09624), [whose code can be found here](https://github.com/russellizadi/ssp). Their code has in turn
